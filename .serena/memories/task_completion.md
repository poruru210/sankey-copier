Before finishing a task: run `cargo fmt`/`cargo clippy` (as needed) inside altered Rust crates and `pnpm lint`/`pnpm test` for Next.js updates; execute relevant pytest suites when touching protocol logic. Update `plan/status-engine-progress.md` with timestamps and notes, and document plan changes in `plan/status-engine-refactor-plan.md`. Mention verification steps (tests run/manual checks) in responses. Avoid reverting unrelated user changes.
