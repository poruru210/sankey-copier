Default to ASCII in source edits, keep succinct comments only when code is non-obvious. Avoid reverting user changes. Follow the status-engine refactor plan in `plan/status-engine-refactor-plan.md` and log updates in `plan/status-engine-progress.md`. Respect existing config indirection (never hardcode ports/paths outside `config.toml`). Prefer pnpm for JS work; Rust crates use cargo. Update documentation/tests when touching protocol or EA interactions.
