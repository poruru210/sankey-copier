Sankey Copier is a multi-component MT4/MT5 trade copier that syncs Master and Slave EAs via a Rust relay server, ZeroMQ messaging, and a Next.js Web UI (also packaged in Tauri/tray apps). Core pieces: `relay-server/` (Axum/Tokio API + ZeroMQ hub, SQLite), `web-ui/` (Next.js 16 App Router with Intlayer i18n, @xyflow/react graph UI), `desktop-app/` (Tauri wrapper), `tray-app/` (Rust controller for Windows services), `mt-advisors/` (MQL4/5 EAs backed by `mt-bridge/` DLL). Config comes from `relay-server/config*.toml` with overrides (`config.local.toml`). ZeroMQ ports default to API 3000, Web UI 8080, sockets 5555/5556/5557. Planning/progress docs live in `plan/` and must be kept in sync with work.
