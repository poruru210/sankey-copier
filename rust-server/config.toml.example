# Forex Copier Server Configuration Example
# Copy this file to config.toml and modify as needed

[server]
# Server bind address and port
# Use "0.0.0.0" to listen on all network interfaces
# Use "127.0.0.1" to listen only on localhost
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080

[database]
# SQLite database connection URL
# The database file will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
url = "sqlite://forex_copier.db?mode=rwc"

[zeromq]
# ZeroMQ port configuration
# Each port serves a different purpose and must be unique

# Port for receiving trade signals and heartbeat messages from MT4/MT5 EAs
receiver_port = 5555

# Port for sending trade signals to slave accounts (PUB/SUB pattern)
sender_port = 5556

# Port for sending configuration updates to EAs (PUB/SUB pattern)
config_sender_port = 5557

# Connection timeout in seconds
# EAs that don't send heartbeat within this period will be marked as timed out
timeout_seconds = 30

[webui]
# Web UI host and port
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080
# Web UI URL (for tray application)
url = "http://localhost:8080"

[cors]
# CORS configuration for Web UI access
# WARNING: Setting disable=true allows ALL origins - use only in development!
disable = false  # Set to true to disable CORS restrictions (allows all origins)
# Origins are automatically generated from [webui] port setting:
#   - http://localhost:{webui_port}
#   - http://127.0.0.1:{webui_port}
# Additional custom origins can be specified below (e.g., for Vercel deployment, development ports)
