# pnpm configuration to reduce path lengths for Windows compatibility
# This prevents "path too long" errors during Inno Setup installer compilation

# Reduce virtual store directory name length from default 120 to 60
# This significantly shortens paths in node_modules/.pnpm/
virtual-store-dir-max-length=60

# Alternative option: Use hoisted mode (flat structure like npm)
# Uncomment if symlink issues persist or further path reduction needed
# node-linker=hoisted
